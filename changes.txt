changed the background to black
created a string called page to control which page the program is on and draw the relevent sprites
initialised page to "start"
created a new spritefont called "font"
loaded spritefont "font" into a SpriteFont variable called "font"
displayed instruction using DrawString "press enter to start" when the page is set to "start". Set the location to centrally in height and padded from the left by 100. Color was set to white.  

System.ArgumentException: 'Text contains characters that cannot be resolved by this SpriteFont. Arg_ParamName_Name'
Solved by increasing the character regions in the .spritefont file from 32 - 32 to 32 - 126

when enter is pressed on start page, variable page changes to "game"
loaded the boxer textures and initialised their positions
drew the boxers when page is set to "game"
added input handling to allow red boxer to be moved back and forth with a and d respectively and left and right for  blue boxer 
loaded in a new texture for punches
added input so that when w is down red punches and up down blue punches 


System.NullReferenceException: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.' BboxerTexture was null.
Caused because boxer positions are dependent on the width of the textures which have not yet been loaded.
Solved by using the integer values of the width and height of the textures based on the files they are from  
System.ArgumentNullException: 'Value cannot be null. Arg_ParamName_Name'
caused by attempting to draw a texture that had never been loaded
solved by assigning boxerTexture in load content after content has been loaded
